# Coding Help Requests

Files are crudely listed above that have been sent to me to help with (via discord or wyzant), browse the repo files for examples.

# Why?

I want to keep track of common issues, poorly worded assignments, or common BS that ML devs deal with.

## Other requests that got their own repo
